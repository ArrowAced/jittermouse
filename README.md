<br />
Jittermouse is a work-in-progress rust program that moves the mouse around every 9-10 seconds using the [Enigo](https://crates.io/crates/enigo) library. It is still very incomplete, and has many features and customizations missing.

Because this program uses Enigo, Linux users may have to install libxdo/xdotool. See [here](https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo#runtime-dependencies) for installation.
