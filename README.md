<br />
Jittermouse is a work-in-progress rust program that moves the mouse around every 9-10 seconds using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/enigo">Enigo</a> library. It is still very incomplete, and has many features and customizations missing.

Because this program uses Enigo, Linux users may have to install libxdo/xdotool. See <a href="https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo#runtime-dependencies">here</a> for installation.
